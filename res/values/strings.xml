    <string name="text_info">Progress is designed to be an aid while performing any physical exercise consisting of repeated 
        transitions between being active and passive for preset amounts of time. 
        \n\n
        Such exercises could include basically anything where the goal is to contract a muscle for an amount of time, let it relax for an amount of time, and then repeat (like e.g. Kegel exercises). 
        \n\n
        It could also be used while doing e.g. yoga if you want to keep a certain posture for an amount 
        of time and then give yourself some time to change into another posture.</string>
        
    <string name="text_help_title"><b><u>How-To</u></b></string>
    <string name="text_help">Progress is run by selecting a set in the drop-down menu above the progress bar on the top half of
        the screen and then pressing the start button at the bottom. When pressed, the start button changes into a stop button which can be used to abort a currently running set.
        \n\n
        A set in Progress is defined as one active part and one passive part running for a number of repetitions.
        While running, the state of the whole set is visualized by the progress bar at the top of the screen.
        The lighter color shows the amount of active time spent and the darker color shows the amount of passive time spent.
        The uncolored part of the progress bar indicates how much is left until the whole set is complete.
        \n\n
        The progress bar at the bottom of the screen visualizes the state of the current repetition.
        While on the active part of a repetition, the darker color quickly fills the bar from left to right and then the lighter color follows, indicating the state of the active part.
        Upon completing the active part of a repetition the app transitions into the passive part, where the lighter color quickly empties from the progress bar and the darker color
        follows, indicating the state of the passive part. When the progress bar is once again empty the passive part of the repetition is completed and so is the current repetition.
        Progress now continues with the active part of the next repetition.
        \n\n
        When transitioning between active and passive, and vice versa, a short vibration is activated, and upon completing a whole set there are two short vibrations.
        This can be turned off/on from the app menu, regardless of whether a set is currently running or not. 
        \n\n
        From the app menu you also have the ability to define a new set, or to remove the currently selected set. The syntax of a set is \"Active/Passive xRepetitions\",
        so for example the first set selected when you open Progress, \"10/5 x10\", has a 10 second active part followed by a 5 second passive part and goes on for 10 repetitions.
